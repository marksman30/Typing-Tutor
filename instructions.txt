A good typing speed is one of the pre-requisites for a good software devoloper.
Therefore this program aims to devolop the user's speed and accuracy while typing.
It provides two modes: typing tutor and story mode.

TYPING TUTOR:
    A sentence(in white) is displayed on the screen and the user has to type it out as fast as possible.
    Typing a wrong character will lead to beep sound with and the cursor is automatically set back(DO NOT PRESS BACK SPACE).
    The text turns green as you type the right character and red is you typre it wrong.
    You speed and WPM is displayed at the end.
    Have fun!



STORY MODE:
    So you found the basic typing test programm too cliche` and boring?
    No worries, the story mode is more interesting way to improve  your typing skills.
    The plot will be briefed once you enter the this mode and the rules of the game are simple.
        -There are exchange of dialouges between the characters and you will have to type the displayed sentence as quickly as possible.
        -There is time limit for each sentence which decides if your attack is successful or not,
        -In case of a loss, a life will be deducted, and ofcourse you don't have unlimited lives :)
        -Try not to die, as your fingers will carry your fate.
    Good luck!
